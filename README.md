# Individual-project
#Brief
- The brief provided for this project is set as To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
covered during training.

## Requirements
- A Trello board
- A relational database of at least two tables that model a relationship
- Orderly documentation including risk assessment
- A python-based functional application that follows best practices and design principles
- Test scripts for the application
- Code integrated into a Version Control System(GIT) which will be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine

## My application
- Create and Read function:
- A functional watch order wesbsite which includes a database for customers to add and store their name, which then increment an ID and order ID to go with the order

- an orders table to record and store order information for the chosen item

The tables was also supposed to have an update and delete function which allows for continous updating of information and deleting of information

# Known Issues:

- routes for CRUD directly to web application were non functional
- testing suites did not get made
- CI server was not made

# Future Improvements:

- Improve time management for each requirement
- hone in on scop better to understand how much time each particulare requirement needs
